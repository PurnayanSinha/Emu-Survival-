# Emu-Survival-
Emu Survival is a fast-paced 2D arcade-style game where players take control of a brave Emu bird, trying to survive an endless series of rolling wheels. The objective is simple: jump, dodge, and survive for as long as you can!

Gameplay Overview :
In Emu Survival, the player uses the "Up Arrow" key to make the Emu bird jump and avoid the rolling wheels that come at a steady pace across the screen. The game doesn't increase the speed of the wheels, but instead, each wheel that the Emu successfully dodges adds to the player's score. Each wheel passed earns you 10 points.
The game continues until the Emu collides with a wheel, at which point the game ends. The player’s score is displayed, and the highest score achieved is tracked.

Features :
1. Simple Controls: Just one key — the Up Arrow — to jump.
2. Consistent Difficulty: The wheels move at a steady pace, with the challenge being how long you can dodge them.
3. Scoring System: Earn 10 points for each wheel you successfully dodge.
4. High Score Tracker: Displays your current score as well as the highest score achieved.
5. Game Over Mechanic: Collision with any wheel ends the game.
6. Fun and Addictive: Easy to pick up, tough to master.

1. HTML , CSS , JavaScript
